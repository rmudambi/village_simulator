**Crops**

Many crops could be modeled, including wheat, barley, peas, grapes, figs, and
olives. The first crop to be modeled will be wheat.

**Sow and harvest cycle**

In Sumeria barley was sown in October/November. Fields were weeded throughout
the winter. Harvest was in April/May. Grain is stored by June/July at the latest.

**Impact of weather**

Hypothesis: High temperature causes crops to ripen faster. Higher rainfall
increases yield.

Rainfall isn't relevant to crop growth if modeling an arid floodplain
civilization like Sumeria.

**Impact of terrain**

**Impact of manpower**

**Impact of war**

**Impact of disasters**

- Pestilence
- Flood
- Drought

**Impact of irrigation**
