**Crops**

Many crops could be modeled, including wheat, barley, peas, grapes, figs, and
olives. The first crop to be modeled will be wheat.


**Research**

In Sumeria barley was sown in October/November. Fields were weeded throughout
the winter. Harvest was in April/May. Grain is stored by June/July at the latest.

**Sow and harvest cycle**

Crop will have a sowing date and a harvest date. Each crop will have two
modelled attributes while growing: progress to harvest and projected yield.

Assume we have equilibrium between wheat harvest and consumption at baseline
with mean temperature. If we have data suggesting that increases in temperature
above mean reduces yield and decreases below increase it, we can compute
variability. See figure 2 from Nature article to get marginal impact on yield of
each day's temperature.

High temperature causes crops to ripen faster, but I don't have a good idea of
by how much.

According to the springer paper, tracking cumulative rainfall from December -
February, rainfall from March - May, and consecutive dry days are the most
relevant rainfall metrics. Reasonable year-over-year variation could be as high
as 1200%. Rainfall can explain ~40% of variation.

**Impact of weather**

Rainfall isn't relevant to crop growth if modeling an arid floodplain
civilization like Sumeria.

**Impact of terrain**

**Impact of manpower**

**Impact of war**

**Impact of disasters**

- Pestilence
- Flood
- Drought

**Impact of irrigation**
